TYPO3 Frontend Rendering explained
==================================

This repository contains the source files that were used to build a chart that explains the rendering process of TYPO3 CMS.

The original article was published on buzz.typo3.org [1] and dates back to 2007 and TYPO3 4.1.
The files have been published in the hope that someone else is going to update the document based on the data of TYPO3 CMS 7 LTS.

If you need more information, feel free to contact Michael Stucki <michael.stucki@typo3.org>.
